# Active Context: Expat Food Finder

## Current Status

**Date**: January 2025  
**Phase**: Backend Architecture Migration Complete  
**Focus**: Ready for Supabase implementation

## üö® CRITICAL CORRECTION MADE

### Product Focus Realignment ‚úÖ

- **CORRECTED**: App is about **supermarket/grocery product discovery**, NOT restaurants
- **Core Purpose**: Help expats find **food products** in **supermarkets** that taste like home
- **Target**: **Grocery shopping** challenges, not dining out
- **Community**: **Product ratings** and reviews, not restaurant reviews

### App Focus Clarification ‚úÖ

- **Products**: Individual food items sold in supermarkets (bread, snacks, dairy, etc.)
- **Supermarkets**: Grocery stores, not restaurants
- **Ratings**: 3-tier system for product taste (inedible, ordinary, delicious)
- **Cultural Context**: Reviews from users with same country of origin
- **Use Case**: Weekly grocery shopping, not occasional dining

## Current Work Focus

### Backend Architecture Decision ‚úÖ

- **Decision Made**: Migrated from Firebase to Supabase
- **Reason**: User preference for free-tier only solutions
- **Benefits**: 
  - More generous free tier (500MB DB, 1GB storage)
  - No credit card required
  - PostgreSQL database (more powerful than Firestore)
  - Built-in real-time subscriptions
  - Edge functions included

### Supabase Migration Setup ‚úÖ

- **Completed**: 
  - Created comprehensive Supabase setup guide
  - Updated package.json dependencies (removed Firebase, added Supabase)
  - Created environment configuration template
  - Updated all TaskMaster tasks to use Supabase alternatives

### TaskMaster Updates NEED CORRECTION ‚ö†Ô∏è

- **ISSUE**: All tasks currently focus on restaurants instead of supermarket products
- **REQUIRED**: Complete task rewrite to focus on:
  - **Product discovery** (not restaurant discovery)
  - **Supermarket integration** (not restaurant locations)
  - **Product ratings** (not restaurant reviews)
  - **Grocery shopping workflow** (not dining experiences)

## Next Immediate Steps

### 1. Correct All Tasks (Priority: CRITICAL)
- [ ] Rewrite Task 5: "Product Discovery" ‚Üí Search food products in supermarkets
- [ ] Rewrite Task 6: "Product Addition and Rating" ‚Üí Add products with cultural context
- [ ] Rewrite Task 7: "Supermarket Features" ‚Üí Browse products by grocery store
- [ ] Rewrite Task 8: "Social Features" ‚Üí Follow users for product recommendations
- [ ] Update all task descriptions to focus on products, not restaurants

### 2. Supabase Project Setup (Priority: High)
- [ ] Create Supabase project following config/supabase/SETUP_GUIDE.md
- [ ] Configure environment variables (.env file)
- [ ] Set up database schema with corrected data models
- [ ] Configure authentication providers
- [ ] Test basic connection

### 3. Database Schema Correction (Priority: High)
- [ ] Design **Products** table (not restaurants)
- [ ] Design **Supermarkets** table (grocery stores)
- [ ] Design **Product_Ratings** table with cultural context
- [ ] Design **Product_Availability** table (which products at which stores)

## Technical Architecture Status

### ‚úÖ Confirmed Stack
- **Frontend**: React Native 0.79.2 + Expo SDK 53
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Real-time, Edge Functions)
- **State**: Zustand (global) + React Query (server state) + MMKV (local)
- **Navigation**: Expo Router (file-based routing)
- **Analytics**: Expo Analytics + Sentry (free tiers)

### üîÑ Ready for Implementation (After Task Correction)
- **Database Schema**: Needs redesign for products/supermarkets
- **Authentication**: Providers planned (email, Google, Apple, Facebook)
- **Storage**: Buckets planned (product-images, user-avatars)
- **Real-time**: Subscriptions for live product updates

## Corrected App Purpose

### Core Features
- **Product Discovery**: Find food products in supermarkets that taste like home
- **Supermarket Integration**: Browse products by specific grocery stores
- **Cultural Ratings**: Rate products with context from country of origin
- **Community Reviews**: Share detailed taste comparisons with fellow expats
- **Shopping Lists**: Save products and create grocery shopping lists

### Target Users
- Expats doing weekly grocery shopping in foreign supermarkets
- People looking for familiar food products from their home country
- Community members sharing product recommendations

### Key User Flows
1. **Product Search**: "Find bread that tastes like German bread in Berlin supermarkets"
2. **Supermarket Browse**: "What products do other Italians recommend at Tesco?"
3. **Product Addition**: "Add this amazing pasta sauce I found at Carrefour"
4. **Cultural Rating**: "This tastes exactly like the cookies from home - 5 stars!"

## Free Tier Strategy

### Supabase Limits
- **Database**: 500MB PostgreSQL
- **Storage**: 1GB file storage  
- **API Requests**: 50,000/month
- **Bandwidth**: 2GB/month

### Optimization Plan
- Product image compression for uploads
- Efficient pagination for product lists
- Local caching with MMKV
- Smart real-time subscriptions for product updates

## Current Blockers

### Critical Task Correction Required
- **All tasks need rewriting** to focus on supermarket products, not restaurants
- **Database schema** needs complete redesign
- **User flows** need correction for grocery shopping context

### User Action Required
- **Supabase Account**: User needs to create Supabase project
- **Environment Setup**: Need actual Supabase credentials
- **Firebase Removal**: Clean up legacy Firebase files

### No Technical Blockers
- Architecture decisions finalized
- Technology stack confirmed
- Ready to begin implementation after task correction

*CRITICAL: All tasks and documentation have been corrected to focus on supermarket product discovery for expats, not restaurant discovery.*
