- **Reason**: User preference for free-tier only solutions
- **Benefits Documented**: More generous free tier, PostgreSQL, no credit card required
- **Setup Guide**: Comprehensive Supabase setup guide created
- **Dependencies Updated**: Package.json updated to use @supabase/supabase-js

### Product Focus Correction ‚úÖ
- **Memory Bank Updated**: All documentation now focuses on supermarket products
- **Tasks Corrected**: All major tasks updated to focus on grocery shopping
- **Data Models Clarified**: Products, Supermarkets, Product_Ratings, Product_Availability
- **User Flows Corrected**: Grocery shopping workflow, not dining experiences

## Current Work In Progress üîÑ

### Supabase Migration Setup
- **Project Creation**: Need to create Supabase project
- **Environment Configuration**: Need to set up .env with Supabase credentials
- **Client Setup**: Need to create config/supabase/client.ts
- **Database Schema**: Need to implement PostgreSQL schema for products/supermarkets
- **Authentication**: Need to configure auth providers

## Next Immediate Steps üìã

### 1. Complete Supabase Setup (Priority: High)
- [ ] Create Supabase project following setup guide
- [ ] Configure environment variables
- [ ] Create Supabase client configuration
- [ ] Set up database schema with corrected SQL scripts for products/supermarkets
- [ ] Test basic connection and authentication

### 2. Implement Corrected Database Schema (Priority: High)
- [ ] Create Products table (food items with photos, descriptions, categories)
- [ ] Create Supermarkets table (grocery store chains, locations)
- [ ] Create Product_Ratings table (3-tier rating with cultural context)
- [ ] Create Product_Availability table (which products at which stores)
- [ ] Create User_Lists table (shopping lists, favorite products)

### 3. Clean Up Firebase References (Priority: Medium)
- [ ] Remove config/firebase/ directory
- [ ] Update .gitignore to remove Firebase entries
- [ ] Verify no Firebase imports remain
- [ ] Test app without Firebase dependencies

## Technical Architecture Status

### ‚úÖ Confirmed Technologies
- **Frontend**: React Native 0.79.2 with Expo SDK 53
- **Navigation**: Expo Router (file-based routing)
- **State Management**: Zustand (global) + React Query (server state)
- **Local Storage**: MMKV for high-performance storage
- **Backend**: Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Storage, Real-time)
- **Styling**: Custom themed components with light/dark mode
- **Forms**: React Hook Form for form handling

### üîÑ In Progress
- **Database Schema**: PostgreSQL schema for products/supermarkets (needs implementation)
- **Authentication**: Supabase Auth setup (planned, not implemented)
- **Storage**: Supabase Storage buckets for product images (planned, not implemented)

### ‚è≥ Planned
- **Analytics**: Expo Analytics + Sentry (free tiers)
- **Maps**: Google Maps for supermarket locations
- **Push Notifications**: Expo Notifications
- **Internationalization**: i18n setup for multiple languages

## Corrected Database Schema Design ‚úÖ

### Core Tables (Designed)
- **profiles**: User profiles with country of origin (required field)
- **products**: Food items with photos, descriptions, categories, supermarket availability
- **supermarkets**: Grocery store data with location, chain information
- **product_ratings**: 3-tier ratings with cultural context reviews
- **product_availability**: Mapping which products are available at which stores
- **user_lists**: Shopping lists and favorite product collections

### Security Model (Designed)
- **Row Level Security**: Policies for data protection
- **Authentication**: Email/password, Google, Apple, Facebook
- **Storage Policies**: Public read for product images, authenticated write

## Corrected App Features üì±

### Core Features (Corrected)
- **Product Discovery**: Search food products in supermarkets by name, category
- **Supermarket Integration**: Browse products by specific grocery store chains
- **Cultural Ratings**: 3-tier rating system with reviews from same country of origin
- **Product Addition**: Add new products found in local supermarkets
- **Shopping Lists**: Save favorite products and create grocery shopping lists

### Target Users (Corrected)
- Expats doing weekly grocery shopping in foreign supermarkets
- People looking for familiar food products from their home country
- Community members sharing product recommendations and reviews

### Key User Flows (Corrected)
1. **Product Search**: "Find bread that tastes like German vollkornbrot in Berlin supermarkets"
2. **Supermarket Browse**: "What products do other Italians recommend at Tesco?"
3. **Product Addition**: "Add this amazing pasta sauce I found at Carrefour"
4. **Cultural Rating**: "This tastes exactly like the cookies from home - 5 stars!"

## Free Tier Monitoring Plan üìä
