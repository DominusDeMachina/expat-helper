# Product Context: Expat Food Finder

## Problem Statement

### The Expat Grocery Shopping Challenge

Living abroad as an expatriate presents unique challenges, particularly around **grocery shopping** and finding familiar **food products**. Expats often struggle with:

- **Product Uncertainty**: Even familiar-looking products may taste completely different from home country expectations
- **Cultural Taste Differences**: Local popular products may be unpalatable to people from different culinary backgrounds
- **Comfort Food Discovery**: Difficulty locating products that taste similar to those from home
- **Language Barriers**: Product packaging in unfamiliar languages makes it hard to understand ingredients or preparation
- **Supermarket Navigation**: Not knowing which stores carry products that match their taste preferences
- **Community Knowledge Gap**: Lacking recommendations from fellow expats who understand their specific taste needs

### Market Opportunity

- **Global Expat Population**: Over 280 million international migrants worldwide
- **Urban Concentration**: Expats typically concentrate in major cities with diverse supermarket options
- **Digital Natives**: Modern expats are mobile-first and rely heavily on apps for discovery
