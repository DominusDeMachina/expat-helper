# Expat Food Finder - Product Requirements Document

## 1. Executive Summary

Expat Food Finder is a mobile application designed to help expatriates discover, rate, and share food products in foreign supermarkets. The platform allows users to find products that match their taste expectations from their home country, share experiences through ratings and reviews, and build community with other expats facing similar challenges.

The application addresses a critical pain point for people living abroad: the uncertainty when purchasing food products in a new country where taste preferences may differ significantly from those in their home country. By leveraging community knowledge and personal preferences based on country of origin, Expat Food Finder helps users avoid unpleasant surprises and discover products they'll enjoy.

## 2. Problem Statement

When expatriates arrive in a new country, they face significant challenges in grocery shopping:

1. **Unfamiliar products**: Even familiar-looking products may taste completely different from what they expect
2. **Cultural taste differences**: Local popular products may be unpalatable to people from different culinary backgrounds
3. **Difficulty finding comfort foods**: Products that taste similar to home can be hard to locate
4. **Language barriers**: Packaging may be in an unfamiliar language, making it difficult to understand ingredients or preparation

Expat Food Finder solves these problems by creating a community-driven database of product ratings contextualized by users' countries of origin, helping expats quickly adapt to shopping in their new environment.

## 3. Target Audience

The primary target audience is:

- **Expatriates**: People who have moved to a foreign country for work, education, or lifestyle reasons
- **All experience levels**: From recent arrivals to long-term residents who want to share their knowledge
- **International community**: Users from diverse countries of origin with different taste preferences
- **Regular grocery shoppers**: People who regularly need to purchase food items in their new country

Secondary audiences include:
- **Tourists**: Visitors seeking authentic local products or familiar items while traveling
- **International students**: Young adults living abroad temporarily who need to cook for themselves
- **Digital nomads**: Remote workers who move between countries frequently

## 4. Market Analysis

### Competitive Landscape

Based on market research, there are several adjacent applications in the food discovery and community space, but none that specifically address the expatriate grocery shopping experience:

1. **Yuka & Open Food Facts**: 
   - Focus on nutritional information and health scoring of products
   - Don't account for taste preferences based on cultural background
   - Strengths: Large product databases, barcode scanning technology
   - Weaknesses: No community features specifically for expats

2. **Eatwith**:
   - Connects travelers with local hosts for home-cooked meals
   - Social dining experience rather than product discovery
   - Strengths: Cultural exchange aspect, community-building
   - Weaknesses: Focus on dining experiences, not grocery shopping

3. **Too Good To Go**:
   - Helps users find discounted food from local businesses
   - Focus on reducing food waste
   - Strengths: Local business connections, sustainability focus
   - Weaknesses: Not designed for product discovery or ratings

4. **Local food delivery apps** (Glovo, Wolt, etc.):
   - Focus on restaurant or grocery delivery
   - Strengths: Convenience, wide product selection
   - Weaknesses: No specialized product ratings or expat-focused features

### Market Opportunity

There is a clear gap in the market for an application that:
- Focuses specifically on expatriates' grocery shopping needs
- Provides culturally contextual food product ratings
- Creates a community around shared experiences with foreign food products
- Helps users locate specific products in local supermarkets

## Appendix: Technical Implementation Notes

### Authentication Flow
```
User -> Social Auth Provider -> Firebase Auth -> App Session
```

### Product Deduplication Algorithm
Consider a product potentially duplicate if:
- Similar name (>80% string similarity)
- Same supermarket
- Same category
When potential duplicate detected, show user the existing product and ask for confirmation before adding.

### Rating Calculation
Country-specific average ratings calculated as:
```
avg_rating_by_country = sum(ratings_from_country) / count(ratings_from_country)
```

### Location Detection
```
1. Check for GPS permission
2. If granted, get current location
3. Query nearby supermarkets (within 100m radius)
4. If in range, trigger notification "You're at [Supermarket]. Want to see products?"
```

### Image Storage Strategy
- Original photos stored in Firebase Storage
- Generate thumbnails (200x200) for list views
- Generate medium images (600x600) for detail views
- Use lazy loading for image galleries
