      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down the Firebase integration into subtasks for each service (Authentication, Firestore, Cloud Storage), platform-specific setup (iOS, Android), provider configuration, security rules, and context/provider implementation.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves multi-platform setup, integration of several Firebase services, third-party authentication providers, and security configuration. Each step is critical and can introduce platform-specific challenges, making the overall complexity high."

      "taskTitle": "Design and Implement UI Components",
      "complexityScore": 8,
      "recommendedSubtasks": 7,
      "expansionPrompt": "Break down each UI component (Button, Input, Card, Rating, ProductImage, Typography, LoadingIndicator, ErrorBoundary) into separate subtasks. Include subtasks for theme creation, responsive layout system, and unit testing for each component.",
      "reasoning": "This task involves designing and implementing multiple reusable UI components, custom theming, responsive layouts, and error handling, all of which require careful planning and testing. The breadth of components and the need for consistency and reusability increase complexity, as does the requirement for both automated and manual testing across device sizes.[1][5]"

      "reasoning": "Location-based features are inherently complex due to permissions, real-time updates, third-party API integration, and the need for accurate, performant UI updates based on user location."
